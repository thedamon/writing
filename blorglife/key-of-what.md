A twig attached to 17 maple keys; seed pods fully intact with seeds inside, except for one which is open/missing. All the keys are properly paired, except the empty one. From variability of appearance and weight of the keys that retain their seeds, it is clear that the seeds inside cannot be maple seeds unless they are heavily transfigured/wrong. One in particular is quite large and a dark colour can be seen through the papery sheath. The keys, other than the seeds, appear to be from the species “Silver maple”, and in the dim light appear almost like moths. If the seeds are not the seeds of a silver maple, then can the keys be maple keys? Perhaps not. It is unclear where the missing seed is, if it has been eaten, or, if it has been planted, what it is growing into.
