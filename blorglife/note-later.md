The fundamental frequency of a resonant rod is given as `fn = n (v /2L)`, where `L` is the rod’s length and `v` is the speed of sound in aluminum. 

The fundamental frequency of a rod of a mysterious substance, encased in an impenetrable glass-like substance ... is unknown at this time. 

David Aldus taught physics and then later, music, at Northumberland college between 1962 and 1994. He died 3 years later, and among his possessions was this possibly resonant rod.

The purpose and origin of this rod is also not known. From a scientific point of view, impenetrability is a difficult property to work around. Its visual resemblance to a tubular bell may be coincidental, but it’s all we have to go on, and it could be some kind of musical instrument.

The rod is metallic and reflects light irregularly. It reflects natural light more than artificial light, twilight even more, and moonlight the most. Being as this is highly optically unlikely, it is speculated that there is more to it.

To properly evaluate its potential, it would help to understand the motives of the person who impenetrably encased it. This may not be possible as that person is dead and, even while he lived, was, according to those who knew him, impenetrable.

It is the opinion of this archivist that it should remain encased. On its own, breaking an impenetrable encasement could have unforeseen side effects. And anyway, the risk is too great.
